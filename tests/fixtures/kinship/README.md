# Kinship Test Fixtures

## mouse_hs1940.cXX.txt

Reference kinship matrix for validation testing.

**Source dataset:** legacy/example/mouse_hs1940 (1940 samples, 12226 SNPs)
**Generated by:** JAMMA -gk 1 (centered relatedness matrix)
**Generated date:** 2026-01-31
**Note:** GEMMA binary not available; generated with JAMMA as self-reference.
         This validates determinism and format correctness.

## Usage

These fixtures are used in `tests/test_kinship_validation.py` to verify:
- JAMMA produces consistent, deterministic output
- Output format matches GEMMA specification
- Kinship matrix properties (symmetry, diagonal values)

When GEMMA binary becomes available, regenerate for full numerical equivalence testing.

## Regeneration

To regenerate with GEMMA:
```bash
./legacy/bin/gemma -bfile legacy/example/mouse_hs1940 -gk 1 -o mouse_hs1940 -outdir tests/fixtures/kinship
```

To regenerate with JAMMA:
```bash
uv run jamma -outdir tests/fixtures/kinship -o mouse_hs1940 gk -bfile legacy/example/mouse_hs1940
```
